installPrinterFromWindowsPrintServer.sh
===========

This script takes arguments 4-11 to install a printer from a designated print
server. If anything is passed to $6 (Driver Policy Trigger), it will be used
as a custom trigger for a Jamf policy designated to install the driver. Using
normal Jamf scoping mechanisms, you can avoid this policy being re-run when it
is not necessary.

Also, make sure to set printserver_protocol, printserver_name, and
printserver_fqdn (lines 41-43) to correspond to your print server. Jamf
doesn't give enough parameters, so if you have more than 1 print server,
duplicate this script for each server.
